Wilfires in California has become a major concern over the last years. The increase in these wildfires is the consequence of global warming, accumulation of wood fuel in the forests, growing number of power lines and population... There is no doubt that California has to find new strategies for fighting this growing number of fires and prediction of the location and amplitude can be of a great help.
